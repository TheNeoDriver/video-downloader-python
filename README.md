# Video Downloader

This project consist in a small GUI for the command tool [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).
The intention behind this is to have a powerful tool like the original but a little more user friendly.
In this release you can search for videos and download them, selecting the desired video and audio quality for each one.

To take advantage of the maximum capacity of youtube-dl and combine both tracks in a single file,
it is necessary that in the same folder where this program is located, you must also have the ffmpeg executable.
(You can find a ffmpeg build made by BtbN [here](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases))

You can find the release of this program [here](https://github.com/TheNeoDriver/video-downloader-python/releases).
